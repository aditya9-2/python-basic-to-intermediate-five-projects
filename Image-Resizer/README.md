# Image Resizer
This is a Python program that resizes an image by a specified scale percentage using the OpenCV library. The program prompts the user to specify the path to the source image and the path to the destination image, as well as the scale percentage by which the image should be resized. The program then resizes the image and saves the resulting image to the specified destination path.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip package manager. You can install OpenCV by running the following command::

```
pip install opencv-python-headless

```

3. Navigate to the image_resizer folder in your terminal.

4. Edit the source and destination variables in the image_resizer.py file to specify the path to the source image and the path to the destination image.

5. Edit the scale_percent variable to specify the percentage by which the image should be resized.

6. Run the image_resizer.py file by entering the following command in your terminal:

``` 
python image_resizer.py

```

7. The program will resize the image and save the resulting image to the specified destination path.
